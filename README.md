# az-unions

This Student Unions HOME page is an updated and refreshed suggested revision of the union.arizona.edu webpage, for demonstration purposes only.

It is a working, mobile-first, fully responsive static HTML webpage cloned from the full Drupal page I created in my local copy of Arizona Quickstart 2 running in Lando. All links on the page actually connect to the current, functioning webpages that they reference. The embedded video presentation works in page, and the Instagram feed updates per the most recent posts. Unlike the dynamic version, this static page disables the search feature.

I really enjoyed creating it, and it's an example of what I can do for you!

Please contact me, as I'd love to discuss how I can serve your department's Drupal Arizona Quickstart needs. (See https://theubersuper.github.io/az-unions/ for my contact information) Thanks!
