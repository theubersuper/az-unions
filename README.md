# az-unions

**_ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE_**

* This Student Unions HOME page (https://theubersuper.github.io/az-unions/) is my first ever experience with the Drupal content management system;
* I chose to use the University of Arizona's Quickstart 2 fully customized Drupal 9 distribution to produce this page;
* It is an updated and refreshed redesign of the current non-Drupal union.arizona.edu webpage, for demonstration purposes only;
* It is a working static HTML webpage cloned from the full Drupal page created in a local copy of Arizona Quickstart 2 running in Lando;
* All links on the page actually connect to the current, functioning webpages of their respective departments;
* The embedded video presentation works in page, and the Instagram feed updates per the most recent posts;
* When producing it, I limited my customizations to the use of CKEditor within Quickstart's existing paragraph types, as I wanted to build the page from the   perspective of a content creator (instead of a developer) to see what was possible with the existing theme;
* I really enjoyed creating it, and it taught me to appreciate both the flexibility and power of Drupal
